DarkRP custom shipments and guns
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains your custom shipments and guns.
This file should also contain shipments and guns from DarkRP that you edited.

Note: If you want to edit a default DarkRP shipment, first disable it in darkrp_config/disabled_defaults.lua
	Once you've done that, copy and paste the shipment to this file and edit it.

The default shipments and guns can be found here:
https://github.com/FPtje/DarkRP/blob/master/gamemode/config/addentities.lua

For examples and explanation please visit this wiki page:
